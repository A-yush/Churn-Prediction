# Churn-Prediction
A Supervised machine learning project based on Churn Prediction of www.turi.com. The labels were made by evaluating the most important
features using feature extraction techniques. 
Used time series data for the prediction on test sets.
Various supervised models like Logistic Regression,Kneighbours,DecisionTreeClassifier etc.

1. Newchurn : contains the feature extraction techniques.
2. Churn: contains the model implementation on processed data.
